### What is Git?

- Git is a form of VCS (Version Control System), it differs from other VCS through it's process of working with data. Conceptually, Git works through what is known as snapshots, unlike other VCS where all changes to files through versions are each stored as base files. Git sees the data as a series of snapshots, where whenever you commit a save to Git, it takes a snapshot of what the files look like in that instance and stores it as a snapshot. Git doesn't copy over files that obtain no changes between versions, instead pulling forward that file from previous snapshot, this is shown in the diagram below.

        # git commit commits all the files in the staging area into a local screenshot and is saved under the messaged denounced in quotes
```
