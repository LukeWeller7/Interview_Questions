## Tell me about yourself.
Hello, my name is Luke, I am from Brighton, and I am starting my career in the tech industry. In my spare time, I enjoy programming classic games from scratch in Python. With my master's degree in physics from the University of Surrey, I have gained experience in coding, presentation, writing, and group work. I also gained experience during my research placement at the University of Brighton, where I conducted phosphor thermometry research. This experience taught me persistence and independence. My passion is to find opportunities to apply my skills in real-world situations and through complex problem-solving. My skill set includes 4 years of Python experience gained through university projects, as well as teaching myself LaTeX and MATLAB while on placement. I was able to write a PHD-style dissertation and a literature review while also presenting these projects to a diverse range of audiences.

Hello, my name is Luke, I am from Brighton, and I have just recently graduated from the University of Surrey with a master’s degree in physics. From my degree I have developed a wide range of skills which I look forward to developing and optimizing in my career. My strongest skill is my coding abilities, with 4 years experience of python as well as knowledge into other languages as MATLAB, LaXeT, and mathematica, I enjoy coding alot and is the reason it leads me to tech. In my free time I enjoy practicing my coding skills through creating classic games such as Pokémon and battleships. As for experience, I have worked both as a cleaner and as a student researcher, as for cleaner I had the opportunity to work for an agency leading me to gain experience with working for a client. For my research, I have gained vast skills in both hard and soft skills, the main takeaway from my research experience was the ever-changing environment and work I had to endure, with this I gained confidence in working in new places and environments, making me a very adaptable and fast learner, this is why I went for DevOps, it's for me the best role to match the skills I have. I am excited to start my career as a DevOps engineer and to see where it takes me.

Lot of technical, need to mention soft skills 


"This netted me positive communication skills" (can use different skills)
which meant I have
